      <li>Positioned as a collector-grade asset that also acts as a rolling tech demonstrator.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="divider" />

    <!-- CORE TECHNOLOGIES -->
    <h2>Core Technologies in Omnimorpha Hypercars</h2>
    <p>
      All Omnimorpha hypercars are designed as technology showcases — spotlighting
      systems that will cascade down into the rest of the Omnimorpha vehicle lineup.
    </p>

    <h3>DriveCore™ Electric Performance Engine</h3>
    <p>
      DriveCore™ is Omnimorpha’s central electric performance controller, balancing
      power delivery, efficiency, and battery health.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time torque vectoring and traction management for each axle.</li>
      <li>Adaptive power curves for Comfort, Sport, Track, and Custom modes.</li>
      <li>Continuous monitoring of thermal loads to protect the graphene solid-state pack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Graphene Solid-State Energy System</h3>
    <p>
      Hyper-V and Hyper-X 2.0 are built around a graphene-enhanced solid-state battery vision.
      This aligns with Omnimorpha’s long-term move from traditional lithium-ion toward
      more stable, safer, and higher-density energy storage.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher energy density vs. conventional packs (target positioning).</li>
      <li>Improved safety characteristics and thermal stability.</li>
      <li>Potentially faster charge cycles and longer lifespan per pack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Omnimorpha AI Camera System™ (Mirrorless Vision)</h3>
    <p>
      All hypercars use the Omnimorpha AI Camera System™ to replace traditional mirrors and
      provide 360° awareness.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ultra-wide AI cameras replace side and rear mirrors, eliminating blind spots.</li>
      <li>LiDAR + AI Vision for object detection, lane boundaries, and environmental awareness.</li>
      <li>Facial and body recognition for secure, keyless and lockless vehicle entry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Halia Integration &amp; VoiceLink Takeover™</h3>
    <p>
      Halia sits at the center of the hypercar experience — not just as an assistant,
      but as the orchestrator of drive modes, comfort, communication, and safety.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Halia VoiceLink Takeover™ syncs the driver’s phone on entry and routes calls/texts through voice only.</li>
      <li>Drive summaries after each trip: energy use, performance stats, and safety events.</li>
      <li>Predictive suggestions: when to charge, when to take a break, and where to push or relax.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Climate Adaptation System</h3>
    <p>
      Omnimorpha’s climate adaptation system dynamically manages exterior and interior
      temperatures for performance, comfort, and safety.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Snow/ice melt functions on critical surfaces during winter conditions.</li>
      <li>Heat management in extreme sun to protect occupants and batteries.</li>
      <li>Adaptive visibility control for glass and camera elements in rain or fog.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- INVESTOR POSITIONING -->
    <h2>Investor Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      Omnimorpha Hypercars are not intended as mass-volume vehicles. They act as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Halo products that define Omnimorpha’s design, energy, and AI capabilities.</li>
      <li>Testbeds for technologies that later deploy into regular vehicles and snow platforms.</li>
      <li>High-impact brand assets for media, partnerships, and flagship investors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For investors, the hypercar program is a strategic pillar that amplifies the entire
      ecosystem — from AI cameras and DriveCore™ to graphene solid-state research,
      Halia, and future Omnimorpha vehicle lines.
