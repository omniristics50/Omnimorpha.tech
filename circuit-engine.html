        <p>
          The Circuit Engine™ is built around a solid-state power spine that routes energy from Omni Battery™ into
          motors, auxiliary systems, and future add-ons — all orchestrated through a single AI control brain.

      <h2>How Circuit Engine™ Differs From a Typical EV Platform</h2>
      <p>
        Where most EVs treat batteries, inverters, motors, and cooling as loosely connected modules,
        the Circuit Engine™ treats them as one intelligent organism — with every part aware of the others in real time.

            <li>Limited cross-talk between subsystems; updates often siloed.</li>
            <li>Thermal management optimized per component, not as a unified spine.</li>
            <li>Range, performance, and safety tuned in trade-off, not in harmony.</li>
