    <div class="section-text">
      <h2>The Problem: Outdated Vehicle Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Vehicles are getting smarter, but their vision systems are still built on
        a century-old foundation of mirrors, fragmented sensors, and basic cameras.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blind spots and limited visibility in fog, snow, smoke, and at night.</li>
        <li>Separate cameras for parking, lane assist, and driver monitoring.</li>
        <li>Rising vehicle theft with no intelligent prediction or real-time evidence.</li>
        <li>No full-body biometric access — keys and fobs are still the norm.</li>
        <li>Accidents often lack reliable, tamper-proof video records.</li>
      </ul>
