    <h1>Omnimorpha Engine Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      The Omnimorpha power platform evolves across three generations — from the original concept Core
      Engine, through the hybrid-realistic V1.5, to the production-ready Circuit Engine (V2).
      This page presents the visual and material breakdown of each stage.

    <h2>Engine Evolution — V1 → V1.5 → V2</h2>
    <p class="engine-intro">
      Each generation refines the balance between design language, material science, and manufacturable
      power architecture. V1 defines the visual DNA. V1.5 upgrades that design into a realistic,
      graphene-based hybrid system. V2 becomes the investor-ready, industrial-grade engine platform
      for future Omnimorpha vehicles.

  <!-- POWERCORE + ENGINE OPERATION SECTION (NEW) -->
  <section class="engine-operation">
    <h2>How the PowerCore™ & Circuit Engine™ Work Together</h2>
    <p class="engine-intro">
      The PowerCore™ and Circuit Engine™ form a unified propulsion ecosystem engineered for instant
      energy transfer, intelligent cooling, and unmatched efficiency. This section explains how the two systems
      function together inside the hood of an Omnimorpha vehicle.
    </p>

    <div class="operation-block">

      <p><strong>Power Initialization</strong><br>
      The process begins inside the PowerCore™, where graphene solid-state layers are scanned in real time.
      The AI evaluates voltage, thermal load, and stored capacity before releasing energy.</p>

      <p><strong>Energy Mapping & Routing</strong><br>
      An AI-driven power module calculates the precise route energy must take to reach the Circuit Engine™.
      This ensures optimized torque, acceleration, and minimal energy loss.</p>

      <p><strong>Engine Activation</strong><br>
      The Circuit Engine™ receives the energy through gold-plated conductors and multilayer pathways.
      These activate the engine’s power matrix, enabling instant and controlled output.</p>

      <p><strong>Thermal Management</strong><br>
      A shared liquid-cooling microchannel system stabilizes both the PowerCore™ and the engine simultaneously.
      This maintains efficiency even during high-temperature or high-performance driving.</p>

      <p><strong>Unified Operation</strong><br>
      As the vehicle moves, the AI continuously adjusts energy flow, cooling rates, and performance demand.  
      Every component communicates in real time to maintain balance, power, and safety.</p>

      <p><strong>Continuous Intelligent Flow</strong><br>
      Regenerative braking returns energy to the PowerCore™, completing the loop and ensuring
      long-term efficiency and extended battery lifespan.</p>
