    <h1>Omnimorpha Snow Car™</h1>
    <p>
      The Omnimorpha Snow Car™ is a compact AI-powered winter vehicle that doesn’t just drive on snow —
      it intelligently clears its own path using the Omnimorpha Intelligent Snow-Melting System (OISM).

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Designed for cities and residential zones buried by winter storms, the Snow Car™ combines
      electric all-wheel drive, AI terrain sensing, and a built-in snow-melting system that
      turns snow into managed ice blocks instead of messy plowed piles.
    </p>
    <p class="spec-line">
      <strong>Use Case:</strong> Daily winter commuter, city fleets, emergency access ·
      <strong>Drive:</strong> Electric AWD with Halia traction control ·
      <strong>System:</strong> OISM integrated underbody intake + melt channels.
    </p>

    <h2>Omnimorpha Intelligent Snow-Melting System (OISM)</h2>
    <p>
      OISM is the signature technology that makes the Snow Car™ different from any conventional snow vehicle.
      Instead of pushing snow aside, it intelligently collects, melts, compresses, and stores it.
    </p>

    <h3>How OISM Works in the Snow Car™</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Intake:</strong> Front and underbody intake ducts pull snow into the system as the vehicle moves.</li>
      <li><strong>Melting Chamber:</strong> Electric heating elements and waste-heat from the powertrain help melt the snow.</li>
      <li><strong>Filtration:</strong> Grit and debris are filtered out for clean melting and smoother operation.</li>
      <li><strong>Compression:</strong> Melted water is directed into a compression cell that forms solid ice blocks.</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Ice blocks are stacked in a rear or underfloor storage bay with modular capacity.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Disposal:</strong> Halia suggests safe disposal zones or re-purposes the ice for controlled release.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      All stages are monitored in real time by Halia, balancing energy usage, traction, and storage limits.
    </p>

    <h2>Design &amp; Performance</h2>
    <p>
      The Snow Car™ is compact, stable, and built to feel like a “normal car” with extraordinary winter capability.
    </p>
    <p class="spec-line">
      <strong>Platform:</strong> Compact 4-door or 2+2 hatchback (concept positioning) ·
      <strong>Energy:</strong> Graphene-enhanced solid-state pack (future vision) ·
      <strong>Traction:</strong> Halia-controlled torque vectoring for snow and ice.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Low center of gravity for confidence on icy roads.</li>
      <li>Camera + sensor fusion for lane-keeping even when road markings are covered.</li>
      <li>Climate Adaptation System gently warms body surfaces to reduce ice buildup.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="divider" />

    <h2>Halia Integration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Monitors snow depth, intake rate, and storage usage in real time.</li>
      <li>Suggests optimal routes and driving speeds based on storm conditions.</li>
      <li>Provides driver coaching for safer braking and cornering on ice.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="divider" />

    <h2>Investor Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      The Omnimorpha Snow Car™ addresses a clear, under-served need in winter-dominant regions:
      personal vehicles that can continue operating even under heavy snowfall without relying
      on external plowing.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Target customers: northern cities, municipalities, utility fleets, and private owners.</li>
      <li>Expandable platform: same OISM logic can be scaled to larger vehicles.</li>
      <li>Brand impact: showcases Omnimorpha as a company that solves real climate challenges.</li>
    </ul>
